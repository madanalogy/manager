# manager

This application is a simple item manager built for an undergraduate course in the National University of Singapore. Course code: CS3219. Course title: Software Engineering Principles and Practices.

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./gradlew -x webpack

npm start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Using Docker

You can use Docker to improve your development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize the application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of the app by running:

```
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the manager application for production, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./gradlew -Pprod -Pwar clean bootWar
```

## Testing

To launch the application's tests, run:

```
./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
npm test
```

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the gradle plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```
